## Katana Zero

### Introduction

> Katana Zero is a 2019 platform game created by the indie developer Justin Stander. Set in a dystopian metropolis, the neo-noir storyline follows Subject Zero, a katana-wielding assassin with amnesia who can slow down time and predict the future. Zero unravels his past while completing assassination contracts. Katana Zero features side-scrolling hack-and-slash gameplay in which the player attempts to kill all enemies in a level without being hit, using Zero's abilities to manipulate time, dodge attacks, and take advantage of environmental hazards.

The game design concepts and assets are from Katana Zero (textures, soundtrack). You will play a katana-wielding assassin with amnesia, constantly killing the enemies in front of you. Each enemy dies in a single hit; and any damage results in instant death for the player, Zero, requiring the player to restart from the most recent checkpoint.

Plan your route, quickly kill all enemies in constant rebirth, and enjoy the battle of one-hit kills.
